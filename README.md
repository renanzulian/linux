# Welcome to Linux Knowledge

In this repository you can learn more about Linux. All content here is from a [udemy linux course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-online-certificacao-linux-lpic1-comptia/) and if you are looking for a good linux class I recommend it. Why do I want to share this repository?

 1. To learn more

    When you writedown or typedown what you are learning you can keep more the content on your mind. Obviously it is my opinion and something that I usually do when I'm study.

 2. Share a good content about linux

    You can find a lot of repositories and blogs that provides content about linux on the internet. But I never find some course really well classified and sometimes turn the course a little confuse. 

 3. Learn English

    I'm learning English by myself using some free playlists on youtube (search from Coach Shane - daily dictation to improve your listening) and I want to improve my writedown doing content in English.

**Obs: Here has only the most important subjects of the course. If you would like to get all content I recommend you to buy the original course.**

## Get Started

You can access all section by folders. All directories has a README with all content about that section. Some folders can has another folders to classify the sections (somes sections has a lot of content). If you have some doubt ask me on issues.

## Setup 

You will need some linux environment. You can use some software to virtualize or use an old laptop. Even if you already has linux like me **I don't recommend you to use your main OS to study** because if you crash or do something wrong you will be without your computer.


### Have a nice study!
