### Working on Command line

The terminal is probabily the first things that peoples remember when the subject is Linux. The terminal is basicly a interface to execute commands on linux. The correct term of this interface is **shell**. All Operational System from linux provides some type of shell (usually is bash). You can find many types of shell like zsh, sh, csh and much more. Then you only need to keep on your mind that *we use the shell to execute our commands.*

On linux shell you can have three types of commands:

1. Internal command
    
    Is an own command of shell. On bash for example you can have `cd` command to change the working directory of shell. How do I know that `cd` is a own command of shell? Easy only use command the command `type`.
    
    ![type cd](./assets/type_cd.png "Adasd")
