# Welcome to Linux Knowledge

Hi I'm Renan and in this project you will can learn more about Linux. All content here is from a [udemy course about linux](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-online-certificacao-linux-lpic1-comptia/) and if you are looking for a good course about linux I recommend it. Why does reason I share this repository?

 1. To learn more
    
    When you writedown or typedown what you are learning you can keep more the contet on your mind. Obviusly it is my opnion and something that I usually do when I study.

 2. Share a good content about linux

    Probabily already exist some repositories and blogs that provides content about linux. But I never find some course really well classified and sometimes turn the course a little confuse. 

 3. Learn English

    I learning English by myself using some free playlists on youtube (search from Coach Shane - daily dictation to improve your listening) and I like to improve my writedown doing content in English.

**Obs: Here has only the most important subjects of the course. If you would like to get all content I recommend you to buy the original course.**

## Get Started

You can access all section on branches. All branches has a README with all content about that section. Some branches can has folders to classify the sections (somes sections has a lot of content). If you have some doubt ask me on issues.

## Setup 

You will need some linux environment. You can use some software to virtualize or use a old laptop. Even if you alread has linux like me **I don't recommend you to use your main OS to study** because if you crash or do something wrong you will be without your computer. 

I used a linux container on Docker and you can use this solution like me following the steps above.

1. Install Docker
   
    Use the official documentation to install the docker on your machine.

2. Select the distro

    Some distros are famous on docker like alpine because is very lightweight. I selected Fedora only because I like this distro.

3. Run the container

    Go to the page of your container and run the commands that they recommend you use local.

### Have a nice study!
